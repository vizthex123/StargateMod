I made this mod because I love the Stargate franchise, and thought it would be cool to have a Terraria mod for it.

It's still fairly WIP, but it does add a couple of useful accessories at the moment.

I plan to add the main things from each faction in the show (Ancients, Goa'uld, Tau'ri (humans), and perhaps a few others)

Full content list:

Several crafting items
4 Accessories (Health & Defense for now)
1 tool (pickaxe)
2 heavily WIP weapons
1 heavily WIP minion
1 new ammo type (currently useless other than as a crafting component)
