The Stargate Mod is a passion project I started (despite knowing very limited C#) because I love the Stargate franchise and wanted to add some stuff to Terraria themed around it.

The actual Stargates will take a long time to be implemented (might not even be added at all) because of my limited knowledge of modding, but you can build a themed one with different blocks and teleporters.

Several crafting items.
4 Accessories (Max HP, Life Regen Boost, extra Defense, etc.!)
1 heavily WIP weapon
1 new ammo type (currently useless other than as a crafting component)
